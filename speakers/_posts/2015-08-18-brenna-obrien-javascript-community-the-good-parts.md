  As front-end dev educator, my heart broke every time a student proclaimed “I
  hate JavaScript.”



  I’ve found the JavaScript community to be extremely positive and welcoming, but
  we can do better, especially if our newest colleagues aren’t feeling the love.
  Let’s talk about barriers to entry for new JS devs, both technical and
  non-technical, and let’s talk about how we can help alleviate them. Learn how
  to be supportive and inspiring in your daily work, how to teach and explain JS
  concepts effectively, and how you, esteemed JS community member, can help end
  the laments of “I hate JavaScript."
