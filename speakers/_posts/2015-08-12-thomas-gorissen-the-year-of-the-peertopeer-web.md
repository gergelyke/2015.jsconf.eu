description: "2015 is when WebRTC broke through. Barely a standard it already has its own conferences, yet is mostly known for it's ability to do video calling. It is time the web developer community becomes aware of all the powers of WebRTC and a browser-to-browser web that can be faster, more resilient and safer. This talk wants to open minds, through the power of code and demos, showing incredibly useful, fun and even ridiculous use-cases (from WebTorrent to Karaoke to Selfies) cut through the complexity of WebRTC and inspire what could become the democratisation of the web."
