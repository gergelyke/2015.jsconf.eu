  We have ethical responsibilities when coding. We’re able to extract remarkably
  precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what
  they didn’t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that
  leads us there? A major retailer’s data-driven marketing accidentally revealed
  to a teen’s family that she was pregnant. Eek.



  What are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so
  intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against
  unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed
  users’ sexual activity data to search engines. A social network’s algorithm
  accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who’d recently
  experienced death of their child and other loved ones.



  We design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be
  tough. It’s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.
